# FEWD Week #7: Responsive Design

---


### Description 


Relaxr's user count has grown, and the number of users accessing the site from a mobile device has surprised everyone, even by today's standards. The product managers at Relaxr have asked you to return to the project and make their site responsive so it renders nicely on mobile devices. They had one of their internal developers make a few tweaks to your source code, and they have given you the new HTML / CSS files to work from. Using your code from previous assignments, or these starter files, build out the mobile layouts for the landing page and blog.

### Real-World Applications

- Use media queries to render different CSS files according to screen size
- Revisit applications and projects to iterate on and improve code you've written 


<br>

### Technical Requirements 

- Use media queries at a 768px breakpoint
- As a user changes the size of a browser window:

  - Content remains in appropriate ```divs```
  - Content remains visible to the user 
  - Fonts change size appropriately 
  - Margins and padding change size appropriately 
  - Content does not overlap 
  - In the blog section, the two-column layout changes to a single-column layout when appropriate 

#### Bonus

- Add different media queries for a 1000px breakpoint and a 480px breakpoint
- Practice converting fixed units to relative units
